                                blood and not a chatbot offering automated responses. That means that I will tend to all of
                                your linguistic needs throughout the whole process to make sure that the translation is
                                nothing short of a resounding success – anything less would be a disaster.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">As I specialize in just one language pair, I can focus all my energy on keeping up to date with
                                my chosen field, while always ensuring that the most suitable word is used at all times.
                                Meanwhile, online translation tools are Jacks of all trades and masters of none, often
                                choosing the wrong word for the given context and turning your painstakingly drafted text
                                into a laughingstock. You wouldn’t buy an off-the-rack suit for your super-important business
                                meeting, so why would you settle for anything less than the finest bespoke translation to
                                accompany it?</p>
